# Tiger Dorm - Authentication Setup Guide

## 🎉 Epic 1 Complete: Authentication Foundation

You now have a fully functional authentication system with Next.js 15+ and Clerk! Here's what has been implemented:

### ✅ Completed Features

- **Next.js 15+ App Router** with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Clerk Authentication** with middleware protection
- **Route Protection** for `/dashboard/*` and `/create` routes
- **Public Routes** for landing page (`/`) and invite joining (`/join`)
- **Sign-in/Sign-up Pages** with custom styling
- **Protected Dashboard** with user information display
- **Modern Landing Page** with feature previews

### 🔧 Environment Setup Required

To use the authentication system, you need to set up environment variables:

1. **Create a `.env.local` file** in the project root
2. **Add the following variables:**

```env
# Clerk Authentication Keys
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...

# Clerk URLs (these are already configured correctly)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/dashboard
```

### 🔑 Get Your Clerk Keys

1. **Sign up at [Clerk](https://clerk.com)**
2. **Create a new application** 
3. **Go to Configure > API Keys**
4. **Copy your Publishable Key and Secret Key**
5. **Paste them into your `.env.local` file**

### 🚀 Test the Authentication

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Visit `http://localhost:3000`**
   - You should see the Tiger Dorm landing page
   - Click "Get Started - Sign Up" to create an account
   - Or click "Sign In" if you already have an account

3. **Test the authentication flow:**
   - Sign up creates a new account and redirects to `/dashboard`
   - Sign in authenticates existing users and redirects to `/dashboard`
   - Dashboard shows user information and sign-out functionality
   - Trying to access `/dashboard` while signed out redirects to `/sign-in`

### 🛡️ Security Features

- **Route Protection**: Middleware automatically protects `/dashboard/*` routes
- **Server-side Authentication**: All auth checks happen on the server
- **Automatic Redirects**: Signed-in users are redirected away from auth pages
- **Session Management**: Clerk handles secure session management

### 📁 File Structure

The authentication system created these key files:

```
middleware.ts                 # Route protection with clerkMiddleware
app/
├── layout.tsx               # ClerkProvider integration
├── page.tsx                 # Landing page with auth state
├── dashboard/
│   └── page.tsx            # Protected dashboard
├── sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/
│   └── page.tsx            # Sign-in page
└── sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/
    └── page.tsx            # Sign-up page
```

### 🎯 Next Steps

Now that authentication is complete, the next epics will add:

1. **Epic 2**: Supabase database integration with user profiles
2. **Epic 3**: Geofence creation and management 
3. **Epic 4**: Real-time status updates
4. **Epic 5**: Invitation system and multi-room support
5. **Epic 6**: GPS integration and location-based features

### 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Build fails?**
- Make sure all environment variables are set
- Check that Clerk keys are valid

**Can't access dashboard?**
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Make sure you're signed in
- Check middleware configuration

**Authentication not working?**
- Verify Clerk keys in `.env.local`
- Make sure keys start with `pk_test_` and `sk_test_` for development
- Check Clerk dashboard for application status
